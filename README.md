# MyGameList

MyGameList is a pretty simple (200~ lines) video game collection page inspired from MyAnimeList.net

	- Shows up a Steam badge from Steamsignature.com
	- Requires a single-table MySQL database to store your collection
	- Based on Twitter Bootstrap


# Installation

	- Copy over all three files to your installation folder.
	- Import mygamelist.sql to your MySQL server.
	- Edit functions.php and change databasename, username and password lines to match up with your MySQL configuration.
	- Edit index.php  and change "User Name's Game List", "steamidgoeshere" and steamsignature.com image to match up with yours.
	- Done! Hope it works out well for you. ;)


# Adding Games

There isn't a administration page for MGL to keep it simple and clean, you can add your games easily from a MySQL UI like PHPMyAdmin if you prefer.
